Motor control PCB

General notes:


Suggestions for general layout (feel free to do things differently if you think something works better):  

4 layers: power plane divided into a 3.3V sections, 2 5V sections, and a V_supply(output of battery) sections, a unified ground plane, and two signal planes in the order of S-GnD-Pwr-S from top to bottom.  The reason there are 2 5v sections is because each pre motor driver has a buck converter with a 1.5 amp output, in order to make use of both, they must be attached to different power planes.  This is because it is impossible to get the exact same voltage on each output pin and any voltage difference would cause a large current surge through the pin with the lower potential potentially damaging the device.
Try to ensure that digital signals do not cross over the different power planes (a way to make this easier is to fill in all the areas of the power plane you don't need with copper that is connected to the GND plane).  
On the board analog ground and power ground should be kept seperate only connecting at a single point. Signal ground should be subdivided into analog and digital grounds and connected only at one point
Without violating any of these other criteria traces between components should be as short as possible.

There is no need to avoid right angles because at the frequencies we are working at the difference in EMI between 45 and 90 degree angles is unmeasureable.
In fact that's true for the frequencies any PCB is working at, even in multiple GHZ range.


Pinouts and Connections Between Components (there are alternative pins for all functionality on the DSC that we are using, listed on the datasheet, 
so feel free to select those if it makes routing easier, but let me know if you do so and refer.) 

Names in paranthesis are the component labels which can be found on the electrical BOM. If you see a part reference in a connection and want to know what it is just search in this document for label
in parenthisis e.g., "(R4)" and that'll get you to where it is listed.

part number is the manufacturer part number which is also the name of component model and footprint you select

The circuit description is broken up into sections by function.  If there are multiple of the same component, there will be a line listing with the component is and then
	a line(s) listing what their pinouts and connections are.
