Needed Electrical components list

The exact components (except MCU and DSP and FSR stuff) are just suggestions and starting points for what I think the specs for each should be.  This list does not cover any circuitry of the BMS.

2x  BLDC 3phase motor pre driver ICs with current sense ampliers for each phase and integrated buck converter( DRV8302)

12x N-channel power mosfets (irfs7730) 

3x CAN transceivers (SN65HVD232DR)

1x IMU (LSM303CTR)

10x Force Sensitive resistor (FSR01CE) or 1x XFSR material

2x STM32F205RBt6 (MCU)

1x stm32f765VI (DSP)

2x 4 channel Op-amp (OPA4376AQPWRQ1)

2x 3.6 volt linear voltage regulator for logic (MIC5209)

1x voltage detection ic (BD4142HFV)

2x temperature sensor/thremoresistor (NCP18XH103F03RB)

3x swd connector (855-M50-3600542R)

1x lcd screen	(LCD-10168)

2x DAC (MCP4728)

1x ST-Link STM8/STM32 v2 Programmer & Emulator

some number of LEDs (potentially with controller inside)

assorted resistors, capacitors, inductors
